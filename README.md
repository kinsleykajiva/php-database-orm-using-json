php database orm using json

The aim is to create an alternative to creating orm data classes that can be configured and be used at run time this will help in managing data variables in classes .

Point to note is that this seekes to create classes at run time more like creating proxy classes that will reduce the need for boiler plate code .

As i have noted in php 7.4 proposal i will see if can make an app that can deduct types when creating the orm data classes

Feel free to pull requests or branches to grow the idea it self i will make time to improve the concept .
